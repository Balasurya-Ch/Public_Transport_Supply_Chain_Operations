# Connecticut State Bus Transportation Optimization  
### Business Analytics Case Study – CT Transit

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **business analytics and operations management case study** focused on improving **Connecticut Transit (CT Transit)** bus operations. The study applies quantitative methods to evaluate ridership demand, passenger waiting times, and facility hub placement with the goal of **boosting productivity, improving service quality, and reducing operational costs**.

The analysis centers on the **Downtown New Haven, CT – West Haven, CT corridor**, a representative urban–suburban route within the CT Transit network.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze ridership patterns and demand trends  
- Reduce average passenger waiting time  
- Improve fleet utilization and scheduling efficiency  
- Optimize bus facility hub locations  
- Enhance operational resilience under demand uncertainty  

---

## 📊 Data Description
- The dataset is **synthetic and review-based**, created using:
  - Publicly available internet information
  - Transit reviews and secondary transportation benchmarks
- The data is **not official CT Transit operational data**
- Values were generated to reflect **realistic transit behavior and service patterns**

⚠️ **Important Note:**  
While the data is simulated, the **analytical methods, formulas, and recommendations are fully applicable to real-world public transportation systems** and align with industry best practices.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key variables analyzed include:
- Daily ridership
- Average passenger waiting time
- Number of buses in service
- Estimated route-level revenue
- Maintenance and breakdown response times

### Key EDA Insights
- Increasing buses from **6 to 8** reduced waiting time by **~28%**
- Ridership increased from **320 to 500 passengers/day**
- Estimated daily route revenue increased by **~56%**
- Strong inverse relationship between bus availability and waiting time

---

## 🧠 Analytical Techniques Used

### 1. **Ridership Forecasting**
- Demand projections with **upper and lower confidence intervals (±10–15%)**
- Enabled proactive fleet planning and resource allocation

### 2. **Waiting Time Optimization (Little’s Law)**
Formula:
\[
L = \lambda W
\Rightarrow
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
\]

**Outcome:**
- Average waiting time reduced by **~22–25%**

### 3. **Centre of Gravity (CoG) Method**
Used to determine optimal locations for:
- Maintenance hubs
- Breakdown response facilities
- Bus stop optimization

**Outcome:**
- Breakdown response time reduced by **~20%**
- Deadhead mileage reduced by **~12%**

---

## 🏆 Key Achievements & Results

### Operational Improvements
- **25–28% reduction** in passenger waiting time  
- **15–20% faster** maintenance response time  
- **12–18% improvement** in fleet utilization  

### Financial Impact
- **10–15% reduction** in estimated operating costs  
- Daily revenue improvement of **~$315 per route**  
- Annualized impact of **$100,000+ per route**

### Service Quality Benefits
- Improved schedule reliability  
- Higher passenger satisfaction  
- Increased likelihood of repeat ridership
